# checkTicTacToe4x4

- Takes in a 2d array representing a 4x4 tic tac toe board with valid characters at each index being "x", "o", and "-" (could add validations as an optimization, including a check that board contains only valid characters)
- `.checkWinner` method returns a string representing the winner, if any, or else "no winner"
- `.anyMovesLeft` method returns a boolean representing whether the board is full or not
- `.isGameOver` method returns a boolean representing whether the game has been completed or not
